# GRAVITY

hey, i'm tour de france, this is the first external exploit i developed with a friend of mine, hope everyone likes it, i will make a few versions of the external free, later on i will switch it to paid maybe, reason im making it free is to raise population and it's not that good due to my lack of developing skills, but i hope it's enough for you to be happy :)

when it says sucessfully injected, you can click insert on your keyboard once in game, and the gui will pop up, that's about it, hope you like it

disclaimer: no need to copy the license key used in the screenshots, because as soon as i posted this here i've deleted the license key from luarmor database, also there will be no license keys due to the external being free for now.
